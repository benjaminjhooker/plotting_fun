# Plotting Fun and Pi
A simple example of plotting in a shiny app using generated data based on pi.

There are two different widgets types (slider and radio buttons) that allow a dynamic plotting environment.  
The `noise` option seemed like more fun to plot more than essentially a line.  

As the range increases from the intial values [-1pi to 1pi] to broader values, the number of 'loops' in the
polar plot increases.
