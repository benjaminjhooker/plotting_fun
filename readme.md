Plotting Fun and Pi
===================

A simple example of plotting in a shiny app using generated data based on pi.

There are two different widgets types (slider and radio buttons) that allow a dynamic plotting environment.
The `noise` option seemed like more fun to plot more than essentially a line.

As the range increases from the intial values \[-1pi to 1pi\] to broader values, the number of 'loops' in the polar plot increases.
